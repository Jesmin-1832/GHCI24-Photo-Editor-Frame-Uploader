  # GHCI24 Photo Editor

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

npm install
---

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

---

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information about deployment, you can read the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

---

### `npm run eject`

**Note**: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

2. **Adjust Filters**: Use the available sliders to:
   - **Brightness**: Adjust the brightness of your image.
   - **Contrast**: Change the contrast of your image.
   - **Zoom**: Zoom in or out on your image.
3. **Apply GHCI24 Frame**: After editing the image, apply a **GHCI24 frame**.
4. **Download Image**: Click the **Download** button to save your edited image.

Now, you can set it as your **DP** for GHCI24!
