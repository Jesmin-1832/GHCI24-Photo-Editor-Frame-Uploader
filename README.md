GHCI24 Photo Editor
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information about deployment, you can read the deployment guide.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

How to Use
GHCI24 Photo Editor allows users to upload their photo, adjust various filters, and add a custom GHCI24 frame. The image can then be downloaded and set as your profile picture (DP) for the Grace Hopper Celebration (GHCI24) event.

Steps:
Upload Photo: Click the "Upload" button to choose your image.

Adjust Filters: Use the available sliders to:

Brightness: Adjust the brightness of your image.

Contrast: Change the contrast of your image.

Zoom: Zoom in or out on your image.

Apply GHCI24 Frame: After editing the image, apply a GHCI24 frame.

Download Image: Click the Download button to save your edited image.

Now, you can set it as your DP for GHCI24!

Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

HTML5 & CSS3: For content structure and styling.

Fabric.js: A JavaScript canvas library used for image manipulation (applying filters and frames).

JavaScript (ES6): For app logic and interactivity.
