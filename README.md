Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. It will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, so you have full control over them.

Adjust Filters: Use the available sliders to adjust:

Brightness: Increase or decrease the brightness of your image.
